**Machine Learning Project - Addressing Class Imbalance**
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for the semester project of the Machine Learning-I course (CSE 602) at IBA Karachi, Pakistan, guided by Dr. Tariq Mahmood. The project aims to explore the impact of various techniques to address class imbalance in machine learning models.

**Project Overview**
Class imbalance is a common issue in machine learning, particularly in datasets where one class (minority class) is significantly underrepresented compared to the other class (majority class). This project investigates different methods to handle class imbalance and evaluates their impact on the performance of various classification algorithms.

**Objectives**
  **Implement Techniques to Address Class Imbalance:** 
      Explore resampling methods, algorithmic approaches, and other techniques to mitigate the effects of class imbalance.
  **Evaluate Performance:** 
      Compare the performance of classification models before and after applying class imbalance solutions.
  **Analyze Results:** 
      Provide insights into how different methods affect model performance across various datasets.

**Project Structure**
The project is organized as follows:

**Data and Preprocessing**
  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** 
    Handle missing or inconsistent data and prepare it for analysis.
  **Class Label Encoding:** 
    Convert class labels to numerical values for binary classification.
  **Data Transformation:** 
    Standardize numerical features and one-hot encode categorical features.
  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
    Gain insights into the data distribution and identify any outliers or patterns.

**Model Development**
  **Manual Data Splitting:**
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  **Model Selection:** 
    Choose appropriate classification models based on task requirements.
  **Training and Evaluation:**
    Train models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as F1 Score, AUC, and Accuracy.
  **Cross-Validation:** 
    Perform cross-validation to assess model robustness and detect overfitting.

    
**Techniques to Address Class Imbalance**
  **Resampling Methods:** 
      Techniques like Random Undersampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
  **Algorithmic Methods:** 
      Adjust class weights and use ensemble methods.
  **Other Methods:** 
      Explore one-class learning, feature engineering, and generation using deep learning models.

**Evaluation and Comparison**
  **Baseline Performance:** 
      Record performance metrics for imbalanced data.
  **Post-Processing Performance:** 
      Apply CI techniques and compare performance metrics with the baseline.


**Files and Notebooks**
  **Data Files:** 
      Includes both original imbalanced and processed balanced datasets.
  **Notebooks:** 
      Jupyter notebooks containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
  **Reports:** 
      Detailed analysis and comparison of results, including visualizations and interpretations.
